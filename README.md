### PribnowBox searching
There is a small project in this repository, where the python script 'PribnowBox.py'is used to

(1) extract the gene position information and related upstream genome sequence of e.coli strain from the input files;
(2) searching the PribnowBox (TATAAT) from extracted upstream sequence.

#### the input files:
e.coli.genome - whole genome of e.coli strain, 

e.coli.pos - gene anotation and position result of e.coli strain



You can download all these 3 files and run locally to test this script.
