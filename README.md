# SmallCustomizedPython
There are 2 small projects in this repository:
### 1. PribnowBox searching
'PribnowBox.py'is to

(1) extract the gene position information and related upstream genome sequence of e.coli strain from the input files;
(2) searching the PribnowBox (TATAAT) from extracted upstream sequence.

#### the input files:
e.coli.genome - whole genome of e.coli strain, 

e.coli.pos - gene anotation and position result of e.coli strain


You can download all these 3 files and run locally to test this script. 

### 2. Percentage of SNPs that are transitions
'SNP_Dense.py' is to search the each 100,000 basepair region of each chromosome and to identify the percentage of transitions within all the SNPs.

#### the input file:
sample.vcf

You can download all these 2 files and run locally to test this script.
